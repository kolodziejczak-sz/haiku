# About the website

This page contains translations of haikus. Here you can find originals in Japanese and adaptations to English, Spanish, and Polish.

I focus on Japanese works and try to tackle any translation problems encountered along the way.
By learning the language and having a deeper understanding of the culture, I hope to reduce the untranslatability we may encounter, especially in the area of poetry.

In my translations, I hope to convey the author's vision as much as possible while adhering to the hypothesis of linguistic relativity and providing clarity and understanding to the reader.

## Haiku?

Seventeen-syllable poems arranged in the form 5-7-5 usually focus on the seasons or the natural world. 

Throughout the history, Heian period courtiers enjoyed a light-hearted poetic
game known as kusari renga ('chained verses'). The game involved
one person composing the first three 5-7-5 lines of a tanka, while
someone else attempted to complete the poem by adding the
following 7-7. The next person in the chain would then add another
5-7-5, and the game would continue for an indeterminate number
of links. From quite early on, the first verse in this game, known
as the hokku, was accorded a special respect.
The tradition of haiku as beginning with the great Edo-period poet
Matsuo Basho.

He was the poet who did most to transform first line hokku from
an energetic, often vulgar popular form back into something more
serious. He maintained the free use of everyday imagery and
accessible vernacular language, but created new depth by
interrogating the relationship between man and nature.
